### What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
I would say the topic of parallelization and speeding up workloads, through frameworks like ray. I particularly found it interesting to read and learn a little bit about how Ray is implemented under the hood.

### Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

A potential investigation that I will likely be pursuing in our quarter 2 project is identifying bottlenecks and further speeding up our current machine learning pipeline. 


### What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

A potential change that I would make to the approach taken in quarter one is making sure the code is developed with multiple platforms in mind form the start, since we originally had some issues with running the code on Unix vs Windows.


### What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

Some other techniques that I would be interested in using are parallelizing / distirbuting our workload over a cluster, as right now it is parallelized over all of the cores on a single machine.
